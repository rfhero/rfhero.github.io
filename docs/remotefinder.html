        <br>
        The Remote Finder Feature is a standard function for Falcon Pro systems and an optional upgrade for Yellow Jacket Pro systems.  It is intended to aid the user in locating a lost remote by periodically emitting audible beeps after the remote has not been used for a period of time.
        <br>
        When the transmitter is first powered on (i.e. putting in a fresh set of batteries) or awakened from its sleep state (i.e. pressing any button when "asleep"), it will emit a series of audible beeps to alert the operator that the Remote Finder Feature is activated. The remote will function normally until one of the two following events occur:
        <ul>
            <li>
            The operator puts the remote to "sleep". To disable the Remote Finder feature, simply hold the OFF button down for about six (6) seconds. The remote will respond with a series of beeps. Release the OFF button as soon as the beeping begins.
            </li>
            <li>
            The Remote Finder Feature self-activates. Unless put to sleep, after approximately 60 minutes of inactivity the transmitter will emit a series of loud beeps at approximately 1 minute intervals. This behavior will continue for approximately 24 hours or until a button is pressed on the transmitter (during a silent period, not when the alarm is going off). The action of pressing a button resets the 1 hour timer and the remote will function normally again until it is "put to sleep" or 1 hour of inactivity occurs again. Please remember to put your transmitter "to sleep" after your job is complete to avoid an unwanted alarm trigger and to preserve battery life (or remove batteries).
